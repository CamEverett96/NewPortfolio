                    I focus on crafting web experiences
                    and designs that works.

                I take pride in making sure eachh project is fully funtional and responsive before it is deployed live. Here are the steps I generally take to come up with and complete ideas.

                            First I focus on the full scope of the Project. Then from there I organize the project accordingly to what needs to be done first vs last. One would call this psuedocode.

                    <li class="services-list__item">
                        <div class="services-list__item-header">
                            <h5>The Research</h5>
                        </div>
                        <div class="services-list__item-body">
                            <p>
                            I find it important to reserach about different market designs to stay up to date on what works and also be able to find solutions to customers problems. Researching other designs aids in creating edge-cutting designs, this allows me to keep a creative mind as well as come up with even more ideas for businneses 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li> <!-- services-list__item -->
                    <li class="services-list__item">
                        <div class="services-list__item-header">
                            <h5>The Design</h5>
                        </div>
                        <div class="services-list__item-body">
                            <p>
                            Clients and business tend to have designs formatted using files such as a png file or similar. To illustrate the design I would use softwares such as photoshop or adobe illustrator to create a mock up design for the design we are creating as a refrence for the build
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li> <!-- services-list__item -->
                    <li class="services-list__item">
                        <div class="services-list__item-header">
                            <h5>The Build</h5>
                        </div>
                        <div class="services-list__item-body">
                            <p>
                            Once The design is prepared , We now start coding the html and organize it accordingly to our mock up design. I use technologies such as html, css and javascript frameworks for a speedy process. Frameworks may include the following : Inky ( Email Development), Sass , Next.JS , React.js , Vue.js , Liquid (Shopify development), PHP, Node.js, and Ruby on rails along with a few others I may use as needed.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li> <!-- services-list__item -->
                    <li class="services-list__item">
                        <div class="services-list__item-header">
                            <h5>The Review</h5>
                        </div>
                        <div class="services-list__item-body">
                            <p>
                            Once the design is completed, it is then reviewed and tested to ensure the SEO grade is adequte and the page loading speeds are at optimal performance. Next, we make sure that the design is transparent across each platform it will be viewed on from mobile to desktop to TV screens. Also there is testing for emails using softwares such as litmus or email on acid for testing different email clients.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li> <!-- services-list__item -->
                    <li class="services-list__item">
                        <div class="services-list__item-header">
                            <h5>The Deploy</h5>
                        </div>
                        <div class="services-list__item-body">
                            <p>
                            Once the designed is built out and reviewed. Now is the time to deploy our project. Companies usually have a domain to deploy the build to. But if not I will also help with deployment as well, as it is an easy process.
